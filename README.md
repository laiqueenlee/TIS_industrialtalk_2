# Reflection
All in all, I think this visit and talk revolving around UTM’s digital system is very informative and important for our understanding of UTM and helped us better integrate by being more acknowledged about the services we are entitled to. In our opinion, we think the industrial talk and visit to UTMDigital is particularly useful and beneficial for first year students as they helped us better understand the ways these services can help us with our lives in UTM. These two activities impacted us greatly, specifically on this course as we are able to relate the theories we’ve learned in classroom to the services that are provided in UTMDigital and better understand our course material by being able to see it physically with our eyes, especially the session where we visited the data center. We have learned a great deal during the visit as we are able to see how theories from textbooks and syllabi can be implemented in real life by the staff of UTM digital center. We think it really helped boost our interest in this field when we were given the opportunity to interact with people who already have ample experience in this field. Lastly we would like to thank our lecturer Dr Azurah and the staffs who were incredibly helpful and supportive throughout the whole process.
